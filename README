This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1623

This script can fold PHP functions and/or classes, properties with their phpdoc
without manually adding marker style folds ({{{ and }}}). 
It will generate the following folds when executed:

<?php
/**
 * This is Foo...
 * @author Foo
 */
class Foo 
{
+-- 11 lines: function foo($bar) ** -------------------------------------------------
+--  8 lines: function bar($bar) ** -------------------------------------------------
+-- 24 lines: function baz($bar) ----------------------------------------------------
}
?>

Based on e.g. functions declared like this:

<?php
/**
* This is fooFunction...
*
* @param mixed $bar
* @access public
* @return void
*/
function fooFunction($bar) 
{
    ...
}
?>

SCREENSHOT

FEATURES
- It remembers fold settings. If you add functions and execute the script again,
  your opened folds will not be closed.
- It will not be confused by brackets in comment blocks or string literals.
- The folding of class properties with their PhpDoc comments.
- The folding of all class properties into one fold.
- Folding the original marker style folds too.
- An "**" postfixing the fold indicates PhpDoc is inside (configurable).
- An "**#@+" postfixing the fold indicates PhpDocBlock is inside (configurable).
- Empty lines postfixing the folds can be configured to be included in the fold.
- Nested folds are supported (functions inside functions, etc.)
- Folding private, public, protected class variables + multi-line param.
- Foloding the class is now an option disabled by default.
- Now works properly as ftplugin

FUTURE
- Better 'configurability' as opposed to editting the PHPCustomFolds() function
  and some "Script configuration" global variables.

CONTRIBUTE / GITHUB
This project is hosted on github as a mirror through
    https://github.com/vim-scripts/phpfolding.vim
I do not own vim-scripts, so please fork mine instead:
    https://github.com/rayburgemeestre/phpfolding.vim
It's then easier for me to accept pull requests and upload new version(s) here,
also I cannot put phpfolding.vim in the ftplugin/php directory through the
vim.org interface.


COMPATIBILITY
This script is tested successfully with Vim version >= 6.3 on windows and linux
(With 6.0 it works *sometimes*, I don't recommend using it in that version)
